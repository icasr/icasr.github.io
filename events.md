**2024**

The ninth ICASR workshop will be held in Prague on September 9, 2024, before the [Global Evidence Summit](https://www.globalevidencesummit.org) 2024.

**2023**
The eighth ICASR workshop was held on September 7-8, 2023 at University College London (UCL). The meeting’s theme was "evaluation" with a focus on how users can determine whether a given tool is fit for their purposes.

**2022**
The seventh ICASR meeting was held June 8-9, 2022 at Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen ([IQWiG](https://www.iqwig.de)) in Köln, Germany.

**2021**
The sixth meeting was held online April 12–16, 2021. The meeting’s theme was ‘Usability’ with specific areas of focused discussions including user experience, interoperability, tool evaluation, workflow integration, and COVID-19.

**2019**
The fifth meeting was held in Bergen, Norway. The meeting’s theme was "information extraction from text".

**2018**
The fourth meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) was held 5–6 November 2019 in The Hague, the Netherlands. It was supported by [ZonMw](https://www.zonmw.nl/en/){:target="_blank"}, The Netherlands Organisation for health research and Development.

**2017**  
At the third meeting in London (2017), the group focused on: tools and technologies for automating data extraction; how interoperability between systems might be facilitated; and the need to develop sector-wide evaluation methodologies. Papers resulting from these discussions are currently at peer review.

**2016**  
The second meeting was held in Philadelphia (October 2016) adjacent to the Guidelines-International-Network (G-I-N) meeting. The meeting focused on interoperability of tools, measuring acceleration of systematic review production, automated screening technologies and accommodating variation in requirements of automation tools for different domains such as animal trials and environmental science.

**2015**  
This first meeting of the International Collaboration for the Automation of System Reviews (ICASR)  was held on 2 October 2015, Vienna, Austria adjacent to the Cochrane Colloquium. That first meeting established a set of 8 principles for the collaboration aimed at the development and dissemination of automation methods to assist in improving the speed and quality of systematic reviews.
