# Introduction

The **2025 ICASR** was hosted by **DESTInY** as part of their consortium meeting. DESTInY is a *Wellcome-funded consortium* on a mission to build the next generation of evidence synthesis tools driven by artificial intelligence, to deliver rigorous living evidence in climate and health that matters to policymakers and other evidence users.

This **10th annual meeting of ICASR** contained presentations and discussion about **trustworthy DESTs** and their underlying automation methods. Topics included:

- Fair and robust validations relevant to real-world projects  
- Living reviews  
- Retrospective evaluations based on gold-standard datasets  

Breaks and discussions facilitated networking and informal topic exchanges.

In the evening, there was be a shared networking dinner with DESTInY attendees in Potsdam. 

The **ICASR** was directly followed by the **DEST Hackathon**, which took place at the same venue on **July 10th–11th**.
